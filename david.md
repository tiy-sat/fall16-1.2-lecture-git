Apparently I deleted my bio from yesterday, so here's another one:
  I was born in California, in Silicon Valley, more precisely. I moved to
  San Antonio at 4 years old, with my parents assistance. I've had several
  jobs but most recently was a professional photographer for the food and
  beverage industry.  
  Adding this line to literally just make a new line.
