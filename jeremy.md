My name is Jeremy Ward. I was born and raised in Houston, coming to San Antonio in Sept 2008, indirectly because of Hurricane Ike. I worked IT from 1990 to 2003 in Houston, but have not worked in the industry of IT for 12 years. Since 2004, I have driven my own pickup for contract delivery, driving over 500,000 miles. I was married but divorced before coming to SA, and have no children. The main reason I came to SA is because I had sold my house in Rosenberg and took a cross country motorcycle trip to Washington DC and back. While I was gone, Hurricane Ike hit Houston area and when I returned, everything was still in chaos. I had a friend who needed a roommate in SA so I came here and wound up staying.
