My name is Justin and I am from Cincinnati, OH. I have been in San Antonio for the last 5 years and have been in various roles with companies. I have a wife and 4 children who are my motivation to succeed in this new chapter of my life. I love sports and I play in a YMCA basketball league. With the knowledge I gain here at the Iron Yard, I hope to obtain a junior Developer position which will give me the experience I need to Freelance and develop apps that will help people. I also plan to teach kids and teens to code and build apps. During my journey here at The Iron Yard, I hope to network with fellow classmates and be a team player to help new coders like myself achieve success.
