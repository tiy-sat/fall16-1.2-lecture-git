	My name is Shaurice Pearson and I am a 26 year old Texas-Cali girl. I have a two year old son(almost three) named Aiden. I was born here in San Antonio, Texas at BAMC and my family moved to San Diego while I was still young. We moved back to San Antonio in 2000 and have been here ever since. Although I miss SoCal very much, I have grown to appreciate and love San Antonio as well. A fun fact about me, is that I’m HUGE into anime, jpop, and anything Japanese related. What I want to do with the knowledge I gain from this class is to be able to get a stable job to support my son and myself. Technology is not going away and I want to share with my son when he gets a little older. It’s never too young to teach our future generation. I would like to help women of all ages to get into the technology world.
